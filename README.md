This repository contains all of my solved problems from various competitive programming platforms.<br>
Please note that some of them (e.g. Szkopuł) might not provide all the problems in English.

## Code copying
I'm glad if my code is helpful to someone, but it's important to remember that mindlessly copying code solely for the purpose of gaining points is not educational.

## Why c++?
All the code is written in c++ since it is one of the most popular languages in competitive programming.

## Why am I doing this?
My goal is to be a finalist in the Polish Olympiad in Informatics:<br>
